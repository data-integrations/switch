### Mailing Lists

CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:

- [cdap-user](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user)

The *cdap-user* mailing list is primarily for users using the product to develop
applications. You can expect questions from users, release announcements, and any other
discussions that we think will be helpful to the users.

- [cdap-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-dev)

The *cdap-dev* mailing list is essentially for developers actively working
on the product, and should be used for all our design, architecture and technical
discussions moving forward. This mailing list will also receive all JIRA and GitHub
notifications.

## Build

To build the plugin:

    mvn clean package
    
You can also build without running tests: 

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be uploaded to CDAP to deploy your plugins.

## Deployment

You can deploy the plugin using the UI, REST API or CLI.
